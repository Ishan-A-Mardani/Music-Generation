# Music-Generation

- This project applies LSTM-based sequence modeling to generate new music based on patterns learned from classical piano compositions.
- The concept is similar to generating text sequences (like lyrics), but here it is applied to music, using MIDI files as input.
- The project relies on music21 for MIDI file processing and music theory functions.
- Tools like lilypond are installed for music notation rendering.
- The MIDI files are processed to extract notes (musical pitches) and chords (a group of notes played together).
